This is the webpage for the Honours/MSc course Origins and Evolution of Language, running in academic year 2022/2023 (semester 2). I will add links to materials (readings, code) to this page; you will need to use Learn for electronic submission of your assessed work, and to keep an eye on announcements.

Note that this course has evolved over the years – the course in something like its current form was originally written by Kenny Smith, based on a preceding course taught by James R Hurford, and contributions and modifications have been made by James Winters, Marieke Schouwstra, Christine Cuskley and Matt Spike.

## Course summary


## The teaching team

The course organiser and lecturer is [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) (that's me). The best way to get in touch with me is in one of the lectures, see below, or by email to [kenny.smith@ed.ac.uk](mailto:kenny.smith@ed.ac.uk).

Tutorials will be run by three excellent tutors: Lauren Fletcher, Aislinn Keogh, and Maisy Hallam. 

## Class times

We have lectures 2.10pm-4pm on Mondays, and you will be allocated to a tutorial group which will meet for 1 hour later in the week (Wednesday, Thursday or Friday). **There is no tutorial in week 1** - tutorials start in week 2 (week commencing 23rd January). 

Lectures and tutorials are both essential to doing well on the course - the lectures provide a broad overview on major issues in the evolution of language, and the tutorials give you with an opportunity to discuss more specific topics in detail with your classmates, guided by your tutor.

### Arrangements for lectures and tutorials
Lectures take place on Mondays, 2.10pm-4pm, in the [Hugh Robson Building Lecture Theatre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=0210). 

You will be allocated to a tutorial group automatically. Tutorials take place at various times Wednesday to Friday, in rooms in the [Dugald Stewart Building](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=0283) and [7 George Square](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=0209).

Hopefully this goes without saying, but *do not come to lectures or tutorials if you are unwell or think you might be!* If you are unwell you can participate in lectures remotely, so you won't miss out and you'll be protecting the rest of us. Instructions on how to access live lecture streams/recordings are on the course page on Learn. If I am isolating or unwell (but still well enough lecture) we'll do the lecture remotely. There is no remote option for tutorials (but still, don't turn up if you are unwell).

## Assessment

The course is assessed via 2 essays, due on 2nd March and 13th April. Full details will be provided shortly.

## Course Materials

Course content will appear here as we work through the course - I will put materials up as far in advance as possible, to enable you to read ahead where you can.

Each week there will be two sets of readings: one associated with the lecture, and another for the tutorial.  

Lecture readings involves a reading (chapters from Fitch's *Evolution of Language*, or other journal papers/book chapters) plus a blog post introducing the topic and highlighting any important points. I expect you to do these readings **before** the associated lectures since they provide useful background information and context to what I say in lectures – we will assume you have done in class, and you’ll have to talk about them. In order to encourage you to complete the reading and to allow you to check whether you actually understood it, there is also a quiz to be completed before each class - arrangements for accessing the quizzes TBC.

For the tutorials you will be asked to read one or more journal papers/book chapters and then turn up prepared to discuss these in tutorials - tutorials give you the opportunity to clarify points you didn't understand with your classmates, but also discuss interesting points, strengths and weaknesses of the papers. For some weeks these tutorials will be organised as debates, where you are asked to read papers making conflicting claims and then debate the merits of the two approaches with your classmates.
